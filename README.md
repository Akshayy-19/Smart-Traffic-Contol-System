# Smart-Traffic-Contol-System
Smart Traffic Light System Simulation (C++) A console-based C++ simulation of a smart traffic light system designed to prioritize traffic flow based on real-time vehicle density.  This project demonstrates a basic implementation of an intelligent signal sequencing algorithm for a four-way intersection (North, South, East, West roads).
